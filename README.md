## Description
This is a project I have done for the AI course in MIREA university (aka "Professional requalification «Software solutions of applied problems of Artificial Intelligence»"), which awarded a diploma (allegedly equivalent to a bachelor diploma). It was a year long course with its first half devoted to things like Python programming, elements of statistics and databases, and with the second part being devoted to all things neural networks: neural network architectures, training techniques, data preparation and normalization, etc.
## Data
The complete dataset consisted of 3192 radiograph images of human spinal columns. With the help of [VGG Image Annotator](https://github.com/ox-vgg/via/tree/master) 290 images were annotated by me and other members of the course, which were used for the training set. Because of insufficient communication, annotations of the data differed (e.g., files used both csv and json, annotated regions had different names) which required the data to be normalized.
